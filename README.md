# streamlit-recipe-app
A very simple recipe app built using Streamlit just to see how all of this works.

I'm trying to figure out if Streamlit is a good fit for some of the things I want to do. This "app" is dead simple. 
Maybe I'll do more little apps with it. I don't know. If you are reading this and have any thoughts on 
Streamlit, I'd love to hear them!
